In this network configuration and routing experiment, the focus is on understanding and implementing static routing using Cisco Packet Tracer. The introduction provides a comprehensive overview of routing, specifically IP routing, and highlights the significance of static routing in network management. Static routing is explained as a method where routers use manually-configured routing entries rather than relying on dynamic routing protocols. This method offers certain advantages, such as minimal CPU load on routers and network administrator control over routing behavior. The key tool required for this experiment is Cisco Packet Tracer, a widely used network simulation tool.

The main objective of this experiment is to equip students with the skills to configure routers in Cisco Packet Tracer, perform IP static routing using both Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI), and set up multiple routers with multiple interconnected networks. The step-by-step walkthrough tasks are detailed, starting with the creation of a network topology comprising two routers, switches, and PCs, all interconnected appropriately. The configuration process is described in the CLI mode, where students set IP addresses, subnet masks, and enable router interfaces, gradually bringing them into the "up" state. Visual aids, like diagrams indicating IP addresses and subnet masks, are included to enhance understanding. Overall, this experiment aims to provide hands-on experience in network configuration and static routing using Cisco Packet Tracer.
